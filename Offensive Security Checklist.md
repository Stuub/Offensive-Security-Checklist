<h3>Offensive Security Checklist is a comprehensive guide for individuals interested in cybersecurity and hacking. It covers various categories that are crucial for offensive security professionals. <br><br>Here is a summary of each category: </h3>

> [!multi-column]
>
>> [!note]+ Recon
>> This category focuses on the initial phase of an offensive security operation, which involves gathering information about the target. It includes techniques such as open-source intelligence (OSINT), network scanning, and vulnerability scanning.
>
>> [!warning]+ Exploitation
>> In this category, you will find techniques and methodologies for exploiting vulnerabilities in target systems. It covers topics like exploit development, social engineering, and web application security testing.
>
>> [!summary]+ Post-Exploitation
>> Once a system has been compromised, this category provides guidance on what to do next. It includes topics such as privilege escalation, lateral movement, maintaining access, and data exfiltration.
>
>> [!summary|center-align]+ Reverse Engineering & Debugging
>> This category focuses on the analysis of software and systems to understand their inner workings. It covers topics like reverse engineering binaries, debugging techniques, and malware analysis.

<h3>By following this checklist, hopefully you will have a structured approach to offensive security, ensuring that you cover all the necessary aspects of a successful operation. </h3> <br>
