Welcome to the Offensive Security Checklist repository! This comprehensive guide is designed for individuals interested in cybersecurity and hacking. It covers various categories that are crucial for offensive security professionals.

## Summary

The Offensive Security Checklist covers the following categories:

### Recon

This category focuses on the initial phase of an offensive security operation, which involves gathering information about the target. It includes techniques such as open-source intelligence (OSINT), network scanning, and vulnerability scanning.

### Exploitation

In this category, you will find techniques and methodologies for exploiting vulnerabilities in target systems. It covers topics like exploit development, social engineering, and web application security testing.

### Post-Exploitation

Once a system has been compromised, this category provides guidance on what to do next. It includes topics such as privilege escalation, lateral movement, maintaining access, and data exfiltration.

### Reverse Engineering & Debugging

This category focuses on the analysis of software and systems to understand their inner workings. It covers topics like reverse engineering binaries, debugging techniques, and malware analysis.

By following this checklist, you will have a structured approach to offensive security, ensuring that you cover all the necessary aspects of a successful operation.
